# Investment Assistant

AI-powered personal investment assistant application to help you manage investment trends, trade ideas, and trade records.

## 🎯 Mission

To democratize investing through technology — empowering people to build wealth through **understanding**, not **privilege**.

## 🧭 Core Principles

### 1. Democratize Investment Understanding
Simplify complex market insights into accessible, actionable knowledge for everyone.

### 2. Eliminate Information Asymmetry
Provide a transparent platform for managing market data, trade ideas, and performance insights in one unified space.

### 3. Reduce Emotional Bias
Transform impulsive actions into structured, data-driven decisions through systematic tracking and reflection.

### 4. Enable Active Participation
Help users move from passive observers to confident investors who analyze, plan, and act with clarity.

## 💡 One-Line Summary

> Turning investing into a fair arena driven by **cognition**, not **privilege**.

## 🧠 Belief

Investing is one of the fairest systems in the world. In the market, price doesn't care about your background, where you grew up, your school, or your network. Everyone sees the same price. Everyone has access to information.

What truly makes the difference is understanding — and understanding can be improved through learning and effort.

Technology and AI accelerate this fairness:

- **Tech makes information transparent** — Unified interfaces for managing investment data
- **AI lowers the learning barrier** — Tools that help understand markets and trends
- **Automation removes emotional bias** — Systematic recording and structured decision-making

In the past, wealth was distributed by connections and privilege. Today, through technology and investing, wealth is increasingly distributed by cognition.

Our goal is to build tools that help more people gain clarity, make smarter decisions, and participate in this fairness — not just as observers, but as active participants shaping their own financial future.

## Installation

### Using Poetry (Recommended)

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Activate virtual environment
poetry shell
```

### Using pip

```bash
pip install streamlit yfinance pandas python-dotenv
```

## Running

```bash
# Using Poetry
poetry run streamlit run investment_assistant/app.py

# Or run directly
streamlit run investment_assistant/app.py
```

## Data Storage

The application uses SQLite database to store data. The database file `investment_data.db` will be automatically created on first run.

The database includes the following tables:

- `gpt_trends`: Stores trend reports and their corresponding ideas (one-to-one relationship)
- `trade_ideas`: Stores investment trade ideas
- `trades`: Stores actual trade records
- `prompts`: Stores frequently used prompts

## Environment Variables (Optional)

If you need to use OpenAI API for AI-assisted analysis (future feature), you can create a `.env` file in the project root directory:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Project Structure

└── .env                         # Environment variables file (optional, needs manual creation)
```

**Notes:**

- `investment_data.db`: The database file will be automatically created in the `investment_assistant/` directory on first run
- `.env`: Optional file for storing sensitive information like API keys, needs to be created manually
